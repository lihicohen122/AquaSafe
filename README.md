# AquaSafe

AquaSafe is a real-time diver monitoring system, consisting of three main components:

- **Python Server (FastAPI):** Handles data management, receives acoustic data from the watch, and provides an API for the management app.
- **Watch App (Android/Kotlin):** Collects heart rate data from a smartwatch and transmits it acoustically to the server.
- **Desktop App (React):** Management interface for viewing diver status, groups, and alerts.

## Recent Acoustic Server Improvements âš¡

### Problem Solved
The acoustic server was missing characters during transmission (e.g., receiving "i,89" instead of "li,89").

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Reduced Processing Window**: From 0.3s to 0.25s for faster character detection
2. **Lower Sensitivity Thresholds**: Improved detection of weaker signals
3. **Increased Frequency Tolerance**: Better matching (300Hz tolerance instead of 200Hz)
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: More detailed logging to track signal detection
5. **Overlapping Buffer Processing**: Better continuity in signal processing
6. **Reduced Debounce Time**: Faster character recognition (0.2s instead of 0.4s)

### Debugging Features Added
- Shows weak signals that are detected but below threshold
- Better frequency-to-character mapping in debug output
- More detailed amplitude and frequency logging

## Acoustic Communication Protocol

### Frequency Mapping
- **Numbers (0-9)**: 3000-4800 Hz range
- **Letters (a-z)**: 5000-10000 Hz range  
- **Special chars**: Comma (2000 Hz), Hyphen (2200 Hz)
- **Control signals**: Start (1200 Hz), End (11000 Hz)

### Message Format
Messages follow the pattern: `{diver_id},{heart_rate}`
- Example: `li,89` (Diver ID "li", Heart Rate 89 BPM)

## Installation & Running

### 1. Server (FastAPI)

**Prerequisites:**  
- Python 3.9+
- Install dependencies:  
  ```sh
  pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic
  ```

**Run:**
```sh
cd computer-app/Server
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Desktop App (React)

**Prerequisites:**  
- Node.js 18+

**Run:**
```sh
cd computer-app/diver-distress-client
npm install
npm start
```
The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Watch App (Android)

**Prerequisites:**  
- Android Studio
- Smartwatch with heart rate sensor (Wear OS)

**Run:**
1. Open the `watch-app` folder in Android Studio.
2. Connect your watch/emulator.
3. Click Run.

## Component Overview

### Server
- Written in Python with FastAPI.
- Stores diver and group data in SQLite.
- Receives acoustic data from the watch (`acoustic_server.py`).
- Provides a REST API for the management app.

### Desktop App (React)
- Management interface for viewing divers, groups, and alerts.
- Communicates with the server via API.
- Code located in [computer-app/diver-distress-client](computer-app/diver-distress-client).

### Watch App (Android)
- Collects heart rate from the sensor.
- Transmits data acoustically (using sound frequencies) to the server.
- Code located in [watch-app/app/src/main/java/com/example/diversensorapp/MainActivity.kt](watch-app/app/src/main/java/com/example/diversensorapp/MainActivity.kt).

## Basic Flow Diagram

1. **Watch** measures heart rate, transmits acoustically to the server.
2. **Server** receives, decodes, and stores the data.
3. **Desktop app** displays diver status and alerts in real time.
